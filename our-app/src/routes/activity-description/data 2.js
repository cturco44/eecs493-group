    description: "Want some light exercise, but feel like it won’t be fun alone? Try taking a walk outside with a buddy: the extra company can make things less mundane. And, in addition to exercise, you may also get the benefits of enjoyable and/or interesting conversations, time for bonding with your buddy, and a nice change of pace from other happenings in your day-to-day life.",
    instruction: '- find a willing buddy (friend, family member, significant other, neighbor, etc)\n- determine the route for your walk: you don’t need an exact route, but make sure that either you or your buddy are already fairly familiar with the area of your walk\n- enjoy your walk! Take your time and make the most of this opportunity that you have with your buddy and are outside.\n',
