        <p>APP_NAME is a program aimed at getting people outside. That’s it.
           It gives its users complete flexibility of choice in time and
           location, then suggests a couple of fun activities to do outside,
           from taking a walk with a friend to a outdoor photography
           scavenger hunt.

        <div className="help-question">About scores/points?</div>
        <p>As you complete activites, you can earn points that count towards
           your “score”. You can see your score in the upper right corner of
            the activity selection screen.</p>
        <p>Different activities may reward different amounts of points.
          Additionally, as you complete activites, the amount of points
           awarded by activities that you do not tend to select may increase,
           giving you an opportunity to try something different for more
           rewards.
